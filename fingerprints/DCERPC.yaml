      _text: This fingerprint identifies evidence of DCERPC traffic which is a specificiation
        for a remote call that defines both APIs and an over-the-network protocol.
        A DCE/RPC server's endpoint mapper (EPMAP) will listen for incoming calls.
        A client will call this endpoint mapper and ask for a specific interface,
        which will be accessed on a different connection.
